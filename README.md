## Usage and Settings

### The Sleek Chat will appear only when you collapse the Foundry sidebar.

- **Enable Drag and Drop:** Allow the Sleek Chat interface to be repositioned on the screen.
- **Sleek Chat Opacity:** Adjust the overall opacity of the Sleek Chat interface (0.1 to 1.0).
- **Hide Navigation Menus:** You can occult the selected navigation buttons in the sidebar to help lessen the cluttering, keeping only the ones your players need.
- **Hide Always:** Keep the selected menus hidden even when the sidebar is expanded.
- **Apply only to Players:** Hide navigation buttons only for non-GM users, while you keep seeing everything.
- **Dice Color:** Choose from various color options for the dice icons (white, red, green, cyan, blue, pink, yellow).
- **dx Result Ranges:** Enter the fumble, normal, and critical ranges for the die roll on the chat.Example:
    - _PbtA systems:_ set the D6s to  "1-3; 4-5; 6" to represent the fail, partial success, and success results.
    - _Call of Cthulhu:_ set the D100 to "96-100; 2-95;1" to correctly represent the system results.
    - If you don't want colors you can set the die as "0; range-total; 0", e.g.: D8: "0;1-8;0". This way all D8s rolls will have a white color.

### Message Display

- **Message Fade Out Time:** Set the duration (in seconds) before messages start to fade out.
- **Message Fade Out Opacity:** Define the final opacity level for faded messages (0.1 to 1.0).
- **Hide Total Result in Rolls:** Useful for systems where you want to show dice rolls without revealing the total, like some dice pool systems.
- **Hide Adv./Disadv. Buttons:** Remove advantage/disadvantage options if not needed in your game system.
- **Enable Debug Mode:** Display debug information on console.

### Usage Tips

After changing settings, you may need to refresh your browser for all changes to take effect.
Experiment with opacity and fade settings to find the right balance for your game's visual style.

Remember, some settings are client-side (affecting only your view), while others are world-level (affecting all users). Coordinate with your GM or players to ensure a consistent experience across the game.
